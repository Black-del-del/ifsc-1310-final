  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>In reading the article on progressive enhancement, I had to immediatly look up what exactly was progressive enhancement to understand what the article was talking about.  A link to the definition was provided in the article.</p><p><strong> Progressive enhancement</strong> is a strategy in web design that puts emphasis on web content first, allowing everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, whilst users with additional browser features or faster Internet access receive the enhanced version instead. This strategy speeds up loading and facilitates crawling by web search engines, as text on a page is loaded immediately through the HTML source code rather than having to wait for JavaScript to initiate and load the content subsequently, meaning content ready for consumption "out of the box" is served immediately, and not behind additional layers.</p>
  <p>While the article helped explain the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it used a peanut M&M anaolgy to explain.  Instead of building the perfect experience and then taking away features to fit a user's browser or software, it starts with a basic, well-structured HTML foundation and gradually adding enhanced features with CSS and JavaScript only when supported by the user's device, resulting in a better experience for those with advanced browsers while still providing a usable site for everyone else.</p>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is considered best practices for web design because it makes sure that web sites built are accessable to all users regardless of their device or their browser.  I can see that this is a huge benefit considering how fast computer technology and changing and how many new companies are entering the game creating new devices all of the time as well as new browsers.</p>
  <h3> Revisions and Reflections</h3>
  <p> After I finished the first version of the final, I immediately knew some of the revisions that were needed.  However, I asked friends and family over the Thanksgiving break what they thought of the project and what suggestions they had.  A summary of the suggestions are as follows: 1) on the Home Page, the links at the top were hard to read.  The web link to Space X was hard to find and hidden by the footer on smaller screens.  2) On the about page, the text was easily readable and some of the pictures were not modified for the size of the picture.  The information was not organized in an easily readable context; 3) on the Contact page, the form was too big; 4) on the Frequently asked Questions page, the bullet points were not necessary and the information being all centered made it harder to read; 5) the footer on all pages was too prominate.</p>
  <p>I made the following changes to correct these problems: I changed the color of the header and footer to make it easier to read.  I also changed the color of container boxes and made them smaller.  I adjusted the text to the left side of the page instead of center.  On the home page, I added the Dragon logo and put it beside the picture of Elon Must with the web link underneath so that it wouldn't get hidden.  On the About page, I modified the sizes of the pictures and moved the pictures to correspond with the information about them.  I changed font and size of text to make the information appear more organized.  On the Contact page, I changed the size of the form and changed the color of the box and container.  On the FAQ page, I reorganized the information and formatted it to the left of the page and took out the list functions.  On the footer, I made the font smaller and shrunk the size of the footer.</p>
  <p> I validated all of the code and corrected the errors.  I then scanned all pages to see if I could make some adjustments to make sure that the color theme was the same throught the pages. </p>
  
    <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
    <p>I find that access to the internet has become increasingly necessary, to the point that not having at least some access to it can lead to significant difficulty in modern day life. Whether this be finding a job, a home, a car, or even contacting others, the internet is needed. This is why the internet being accesible to those with disabilitys is very important. Whether it be those with physical disabilities that require helpful programs/devices such as eye trackers that move the mouse for them or AI that let the user speak and work the computer without ever touching it physically, these tools are needed and valuable. I find that web accessability is both a vital and needed field that will continue to advance to match everyones needs.</p>
