  <h3> Revisions and Reflections</h3>
  <p> After I finished the first version of the final, I immediately knew some of the revisions that were needed.  However, I asked friends and family over the Thanksgiving break what they thought of the project and what suggestions they had.  A summary of the suggestions are as follows: 1) on the Home Page, the links at the top were hard to read.  The web link to Space X was hard to find and hidden by the footer on smaller screens.  2) On the about page, the text was easily readable and some of the pictures were not modified for the size of the picture.  The information was not organized in an easily readable context; 3) on the Contact page, the form was too big; 4) on the Frequently asked Questions page, the bullet points were not necessary and the information being all centered made it harder to read; 5) the footer on all pages was too prominate.</p>
  <p>I made the following changes to correct these problems: I changed the color of the header and footer to make it easier to read.  I also changed the color of container boxes and made them smaller.  I adjusted the text to the left side of the page instead of center.  On the home page, I added the Dragon logo and put it beside the picture of Elon Must with the web link underneath so that it wouldn't get hidden.  On the About page, I modified the sizes of the pictures and moved the pictures to correspond with the information about them.  I changed font and size of text to make the information appear more organized.  On the Contact page, I changed the size of the form and changed the color of the box and container.  On the FAQ page, I reorganized the information and formatted it to the left of the page and took out the list functions.  On the footer, I made the font smaller and shrunk the size of the footer.</p>
  <p> I validated all of the code and corrected the errors.  I then scanned all pages to see if I could make some adjustments to make sure that the color theme was the same throught the pages. </p>
  
    <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
    <p>I find that access to the internet has become increasingly necessary, to the point that not having at least some access to it can lead to significant difficulty in modern day life. Whether this be finding a job, a home, a car, or even contacting others, the internet is needed. This is why the internet being accesible to those with disabilitys is very important. Whether it be those with physical disabilities that require helpful programs/devices such as eye trackers that move the mouse for them or AI that let the user speak and work the computer without ever touching it physically, these tools are needed and valuable. I find that web accessability is both a vital and needed field that will continue to advance to match everyones needs.</p>
